# DUOS Web

This app is a minimal interface for sending personalized surveys to authors of academic papers whose works get picked up by the DUOS web crawler.

The results of the survey are to be used to tag and validate collected data for the study, with the intention of ultimately refining our model.

### Ingredients

- 🌐 Django because I wanted to try it
- 🧙‍♂️ SQLAlchemy to get up close to the SQL
- 🐍 Pipenv to march toward the future
- ◼️ Black to keep things clean
- ⚛️ React cuz you gotta
- 🚀 Parcel because who wants config
- ✨ Bulma for good looks
- 👾 Heroku for a clutch deploy
